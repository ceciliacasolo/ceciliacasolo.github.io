title: "Signature kernel conditional independence tests in causal discovery for stochastic processes"
collection: publications
category: preprints
excerpt: ' In this paper, we develop a kernel-based test of conditional independence (CI) on "path-space" -- solutions to SDEs -- by leveraging recent advances in signature kernels. We demonstrate strictly superior performance of our proposed CI test compared to existing approaches on path-space. Then, we develop constraint-based causal discovery algorithms for acyclic stochastic dynamical systems (allowing for loops) that leverage temporal information to recover the entire directed graph.'

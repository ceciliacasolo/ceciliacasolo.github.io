I am a PhD student in Niki Kilbertus group in TUM and Helmholtz Munich. I graduated Cum Laude from TU Delft in the Applied Mathematics MSc and pursued my thesis on Causal Fairness of Machine Learning at ETH supervised by Marloes Maathuis and Georg Jongbloed. I am broadly interested in causality and Machine Learning. I have been working on the intersection between dynamical systems, representation learning and causal fairness.  I am part of Konrad Zuse School of Excellence of RelAI, graduate school focusing on reliable AI. During my PhD, I have co-organized the workshop a causal view on dynamical systems @ NeurIPS 2022.
